# Plate Detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients 

## Prerequisites:
  - Libraries
      1. [dlib] (http://dlib.net/)
      2. [opencv] (http://opencv.org/downloads.html) 
  
  - Additional Resources
      1. Pretrained SVM files for license plates. You can use dlib's [object detector](http://dlib.net/fhog_object_detector_ex.cpp.html) to create such files. In this case you need to collect license plates samples.
      2. For testing you need a sample video or an RTSP stream.
